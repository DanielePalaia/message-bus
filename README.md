# message-bus
A generic multithreading message bus written in C++11

This is an implementation of a generic multithreading message-bus written using the new C++11 threading primitives and tested with google test and google mock.

Still instable and not 100% complete, but a good starting point.

An application can use the eventbus.hpp and publish.hpp primitive (publish, subscribe, unsubscribe) and use the message bus functionality.
